# Performance and Lifecycle

Run these checks alongside Visual refinement; both must pass. Choose components
according to data cardinality, update frequency, and object lifetime as well as
appearance. Avoid unbounded content materialization, rebuilding stable rows for
every event, and retaining one-shot surfaces for the window's lifetime.

## Classify the data before choosing a viewport

Record the expected and stress cardinality, whether growth is bounded, and the
update shape for every repeated surface:

| Data shape | Preferred ownership | Required performance contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Small finite composition | Layout inside `ScrollView` when it can exceed the viewport | Child count is intentionally bounded |
| Long or growing flat collection | `ListView` + `QAbstractItemModel` + delegate | Rows are virtualized; inserts and changes are incremental |
| Long hierarchy | `TreeView` + model + delegate | Expansion does not instantiate the whole subtree |
| Two-dimensional collection | `GridView` + model + delegate | Cell materialization is viewport-bounded |
| One large document/canvas | `ScrollView` or a document/canvas control | The content is one logical surface, not a widget per record |
| Live stream | Item model plus batching, paging/windowing, and tail-follow policy | Bursts do not rebuild the full history or force-scroll a reader |

`ScrollView` virtualizes neither child widgets nor caller-owned data. Do not use
`ScrollView + QVBoxLayout + one QWidget per record` for sessions, messages,
events, logs, search results, transfers, notifications, or any other collection
that can grow with user activity.

## Preserve item-view virtualization

To preserve virtualization in `ListView`, `TreeView`, or `GridView`, apply all
of these rules:

- store row state in a `QAbstractItemModel` or a tested proxy model;
- paint rich rows with a delegate; do not call `setIndexWidget()` for every row
  or open an unbounded set of persistent editors;
- if interactive editors are essential, create them only for visible rows and
  recycle or close them as rows leave the viewport;
- use `beginInsertRows`, `beginRemoveRows`, `dataChanged`, and targeted layout
  changes; do not reset the model or rebuild every row for an append or token
  update;
- coalesce high-frequency stream updates to a frame-sized interval when the
  protocol can deliver faster than the display needs to repaint;
- preserve the reader's scroll anchor. Follow the tail only when the user was
  already near the tail or explicitly requested it;
- keep delegate caches bounded and key them by content, width, scale, and theme.
  Invalidate them when any key changes;
- avoid a persistent `QTextDocument`, image decoder, syntax highlighter, or
  other heavy renderer per historical row. Cache only a bounded working set.

Variable-height rich rows still need measured height. Cache compact height
metadata separately from heavy render objects, and exercise long Markdown,
CJK, emoji, code blocks, and width changes. A fixed row height is valid only
when the product deliberately previews or elides content and provides a clear
way to inspect the full value.

## Bound the data, not only the widgets

An item view bounds presentation objects; it does not automatically bound the
model, transport response, decoded images, or retained rich-text cache. For an
unbounded or server-owned history, define one of these policies explicitly:

1. cursor/keyset pagination with `canFetchMore()`/`fetchMore()` or an equivalent
   controller;
2. a documented recent-item window with an older-history affordance;
3. a domain-specific retention limit where older data is durably available
   elsewhere;
4. a proven finite upper bound.

Prefer cursor/keyset pagination for mutable histories. Do not silently discard
older rows. If the current backend only exposes a full snapshot, record that as
an integration limitation, cap the client projection when correctness permits,
and do not claim end-to-end bounded memory until the transport is paged.

Apply backpressure to producers independently of painting. Cap queued work,
cancel stale requests on scope changes, reject late results by request/session
identity, and move parsing or expensive formatting off the GUI thread when it
can exceed an interaction frame.

## Separate organization, retention, and execution capacity

For tasks, sessions, documents, transfers, jobs, and other runnable records,
model these as different contracts:

| Concern | User model | Engineering control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Organization | groups, projects, folders, filters, or history | model roles, proxy models, ordering, persistence |
| Retention | what remains available to review or resume | pagination, archival, durable storage, explicit in-memory limits |
| Execution admission | what may actively consume CPU, network, model, or subprocess capacity | FIFO/priority scheduler, queue state, cancellation, retry |

Do not expose an executor limit as a limit on creating, reviewing, or grouping
records. If capacity is exhausted, preserve the record and show an honest
queued state with position or reason, cancellation, and deterministic
admission. A fixed number may be a runtime default or advanced setting; it is
not navigation copy unless the user must act on it.

Likewise, a folder or group must not imply process isolation, independent
filesystem state, persistence, or scheduling priority unless the underlying
model provides that behavior. Test organization and admission separately:
group moves preserve identity and state, while queue tests cover ordering,
duplicate admission, cancellation, teardown, and slot release.

## Choose transient lifetime deliberately

Classify each secondary surface by frequency, state, and cost:

| Surface | Default lifecycle |
| --- | --- |
| One-shot confirmation, question, picker, or error dialog | Construct when requested; parent or guard it; delete after finish/close |
| Anchored menu, flyout, teaching tip, or contextual preview | Construct on demand; destroy on dismissal unless rapid reuse is measured |
| Temporary drawer with cheap derived content | Create lazily on first open; release on close when rebuilding is cheap |
| Frequently toggled, stateful inspector | Create lazily and cache only while its retained state/cost justifies it |
| Persistent primary pane | Construct with the shell or lazily with an explicit cache policy |

For Qt C++, use a parent plus `QPointer` (or another explicit guarded owner),
connect `finished`/`closed` to cleanup, clear controller pointers on destruction,
and make repeated close/session-switch paths idempotent. `WA_DeleteOnClose` is
acceptable when every access is guarded. Never keep a raw pointer that can
survive deferred deletion.

For PySide6, keep one explicit Python owner while open, call `deleteLater()` on
finish when appropriate, clear references, and avoid signal closures that keep
the surface alive accidentally.

Do not destroy a surface before its exit animation or callback completes. Use
the component's `closed`/`finished` signal rather than guessing with a timer.

## Set measurable budgets

Add deterministic tests proportional to the surface:

- load at least 10,000 lightweight rows (or a domain-realistic equivalent) and
  verify the number of row widgets/heavy render objects stays viewport-bounded;
- append and update rows and assert the model emits targeted insert/change
  signals rather than `modelReset`;
- replay a burst and verify batching, cancellation, and stale-result rejection;
- scroll away from the tail, append data, and verify the reader is not dragged
  back; then explicitly follow and verify convergence;
- open and close a one-shot dialog repeatedly and require the live instance
  count to return to baseline after deferred deletion;
- switch theme and width under dense data and require bounded caches to
  invalidate without clipping or stale colors.

Start with deterministic checks for model signals, retained-row limits, object
counts, cache limits, request identities, and teardown completion. Use elapsed
time and RSS as additional diagnostics; they can vary in CI.

## Acceptance gate

- Performance acceptance is independent of visual acceptance; both must pass.
- Every repeated surface declares finite composition, model/view virtualization,
  pagination/windowing, or another explicit upper bound.
- No unbounded collection is implemented as a layout full of child widgets.
- Stream updates change only affected model rows and are coalesced when needed.
- Tail-follow respects deliberate user scrolling.
- Heavy delegate/document/image caches have measured limits and invalidation.
- One-shot transient surfaces are absent from the idle object tree and return
  to zero live instances after close.
- Cached drawers or inspectors have a written reuse reason and are lazy-loaded.
- Session/workspace changes cancel or ignore stale asynchronous work.
- Organization, retention, and execution admission are separate contracts;
  executor capacity never silently limits task/session creation.
- Runnable overflow has an explicit queued/rejected policy with visible state,
  cancellation, ordering, and deterministic tests.
- Performance tests exercise realistic dense data, not only 0/1/2/8 rows.
