# Component Selection

Choose controls after defining the product signature and information
architecture. Match each control to user intent, state semantics, and layout
ownership. A visual resemblance does not establish that match.

If you used a product reference, check its component suggestions against the
selected concept and query the FluentQt catalog again. Do not copy the
reference's widget inventory.

## Produce a decision table

Before implementation, record the important choices:

| Intent | Required state/behavior | Chosen component | Rejected alternative | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Example: run one primary operation | async, disabled while running | `Button` Accent | `ToggleButton` | `--guide actions`, public sample |

Include shell/navigation, primary input, primary action, result presentation,
status/progress, optional detail, and overlays. Small self-evident labels and
dividers do not need individual rows.

## Run a semantic opportunity scan

After the interface concept is selected, query the relevant selection guides
and classify plausible component families as **must use**, **conditional**, or
**not applicable**. Include the semantic trigger for every must-use or
conditional family. For example, a temporary inspectable side surface can make
`DrawerView` conditional; it becomes must-use only when the workflow actually
contains such details.

There is no minimum component count. Use a control only when it owns a required
behavior, state, lifetime, or data shape. Let the product's primary object, time
model, and signature surface determine the composition and the controls it needs.

## Decide in this order

1. **Semantics:** action, persistent setting, selection, navigation, disclosure,
   progress, feedback, or content.
2. **Lifetime and scope:** persistent, modal, anchored transient, temporary side
   panel, or top-level window.
3. **Data shape:** scalar, short choice list, long collection, hierarchy,
   document, or stream; include expected cardinality and whether it is bounded.
4. **Interaction:** keyboard focus, selection, reordering, cancellation,
   validation, and destructive behavior.
5. **Density:** prominent task surface, normal content, compact toolbar, or
   icon-only chrome.

Choose the component's supported size/style variant before forcing geometry.
Use compact variants for title bars, toolbars, navigation footers, and dense
developer/productivity shells. Do not enlarge a component merely to fill an
underspecified layout; fix the surface hierarchy and spacing instead.

Query the matching catalog guide, then inspect each shortlisted component.
`<skill-root>` is the directory that contains this skill's `SKILL.md`.

```bash
python3 <skill-root>/scripts/query_catalog.py --guide actions --json
python3 <skill-root>/scripts/query_catalog.py --guide layout-surfaces --json
python3 <skill-root>/scripts/query_catalog.py --component button --json
```

Query one decision or closely related intent per call. Use a broad natural
language query only to form an initial shortlist; do not expect one search to
decide an entire screen.

Verify the public header/import, supported sample, and focused test. Catalog
retrieval is evidence gathering, not permission to use every returned control.

### Collection rows

For collection and model/view controls, inspect the code that builds the live
sample, not only the displayed snippet. Record the model roles, delegate,
selection-indicator owner, row height, icon size, and any proxy model. Ordinary
`ListView` text/icon rows may use its built-in delegate; richer rows need an
explicit delegate whose indicator and content insets match the reference.
When a custom row fill already owns selection, call
`setSelectionIndicatorVisible(false)` and do not paint a second indicator in
the delegate. Keep the real selection model; presentation is not a reason to
discard keyboard or accessibility selection semantics.
Variable-height custom delegates must clip and keep `sizeHint == paint`.
Gallery's default 32 to 36 px uniform rows can hide overlap. Use compact Caption
chips for tool/step rows, with name and status on one line; Standard-sized cards
are too tall for this content.

### Material and background

A backgroundless `ListView`/`TreeView` that directly reveals composited Mica
must erase its viewport (`CompositionMode_Source`). Filled Gallery lists never
exercise that path. A backgroundless `GridView` uses the same public
`backgroundVisible` contract. When any of these views sits on an intentionally
painted parent instead of directly on composited material, set
`fluentPreserveParentSurface` on both the view and viewport and set
`Qt::WA_NoSystemBackground` on the viewport; remove all three together if the
view returns to direct material. Keep a background when the view is itself the
bounded surface.

### Text input

A `TextEdit` used as a composer must `setLineHeight` from the text font's
`lineSpacing()`, not `ControlHeight::Standard` (32).
Message-style composers should also call `setTabChangesFocus(true)`, give the
next primary action `Qt::StrongFocus`, and set an explicit tab order. Verify
that Tab moves focus without inserting `\t` on macOS. At the declared maximum
line count, the first overflow line must be fully owned by the editor scroll
viewport; no glyph may paint through the focus stroke.

### Growing data

For long or growing data, also record paging/windowing, incremental update,
cache, and editor-materialization policies. `ScrollView` does not virtualize a
layout of child widgets; `ListView` loses virtualization if every index receives
a persistent widget. Follow [Performance and lifecycle](performance-lifecycle.md).

## Common shell choices

- Use `NavigationView` for several fixed top-level product areas.
- Use `TabView` for user-managed peer documents or work surfaces.
- Use `Pivot` or `SelectorBar` for a small set of nearby peer views.
- Use `StackView` for push/pop task flow.
- Use `Breadcrumb` for a real navigable hierarchy, not decoration.
- Use a focused custom sidebar only when it expresses task/session structure
  that the public navigation components cannot model cleanly.

## Grouping and secondary surfaces

- Prefer spacing and typography before adding a `Card`.
- Use `Card` when the surface has a distinct fill, boundary, selection, or
  independent interaction. Do not wrap the composer or pane header in a `Card`
  to fake hierarchy on Mica.
- Use `Divider` for a lightweight region boundary.
- Use `Expander` for one disclosure and `Accordion` for coordinated sections.
- Use `SplitView` when users need persistent resizable regions.
- Use `DrawerView` for a temporary edge panel; use `ContentDialog` for a
  blocking same-window decision; use `Flyout` for anchored contextual content.

## Actions and feedback

- Accent `Button`: one primary commit action in a region.
- Standard `Button`: ordinary visible action.
- Subtle `Button`: window chrome, compact toolbar, or low-emphasis action.
- `DropDownButton` Subtle: pane-header switchers on window material.
- `ComboBox`: forms and settings. Do not use its filled bezel as a Mica pane
  title.
- `ToggleButton`: an action surface that must communicate on/off state.
- `ToggleSwitch`: a persistent setting that takes effect immediately.
- `InfoBar`: persistent inline status or validation with optional action.
- `Toast`: brief confirmation that does not require resolution.
- `ProgressBar`: comparable or precise progress; `ProgressRing`: compact
  activity; `Shimmer`: geometry-preserving initial load.

Destructive behavior must be explicit in wording and interaction state; do not
make every dangerous action permanently red if the component supports a
critical hover/confirmation contract.

## Raw Qt exception rule

Use a raw Qt widget only when no public FluentQt component expresses the needed
contract or a platform/native behavior is essential. Document the gap, keep the
widget behind a small adapter/subclass, and provide Fluent typography, palette,
focus, spacing, and Light/Dark behavior. Do not replace a missing reusable
component with duplicated custom paint code inside an application without
first evaluating composition.

## Component acceptance gate

- Every major control has one clear semantic job.
- The shell follows the selected product concept rather than the first catalog
  pattern returned.
- The opportunity scan contains no decorative component justified only by
  variety, novelty, or quota.
- No page contains competing accent actions.
- Collection controls match hierarchy and selection needs.
- Temporary content uses the correct modal/modeless/anchored lifetime.
- One-shot surfaces are created on demand and destroyed after close; any cached
  temporary surface is lazy and justified by state or measured reuse cost.
- Unbounded collections use model/view virtualization plus a separate paging,
  retention, and incremental-update contract.
- Visible raw Qt exceptions are documented and theme-aware.
- The implemented API matches the verified public sample or header.
- Component size variants match the region's declared density; peer controls do
  not drift into unrelated heights or icon scales.
- Collection rows keep their selection indicator, icon, and text in separate
  measured slots in rest, selected, and hover states.
- Variable-height delegates clip to the row and report a `sizeHint` equal to
  painted height; tool chips hug Caption metrics rather than Standard control
  height.
