# Art Direction and Human Selection

New GUIs, new shells, and major redesigns need a human-approved visual direction
before implementation. Focused corrections keep their accepted direction and
do not repeat concept selection.

The initializer emits design-brief contract v4. Contracts v2/v3 remain readable
as legacy inputs, but they do not pass the current direct design gate for new
work.

## Define the visual world

Start with product evidence and any taste signals supplied by the user: named
products, screenshots, brand material, adjectives, disliked patterns, or a
current build. Do not infer that “Fluent” means a generic Windows settings
screen.

Read [Design intelligence](design-intelligence.md). Record `taste_context` and
`subject_vernacular` before describing the visual world. The subject record
must name materials, artifacts, instruments, verbs, and tempo. The taste record
must separate explicit human/project evidence from inferred references and
name recent generic or repeated patterns that must not recur.

Record one `art_direction` object in the design brief:

- concise, distinct desired impressions grounded in the product;
- a domain-specific visual world, expressed as a short scene or relationship
  rather than a style label such as “modern” or “premium”;
- one signature element recognizable without the logo or accent color;
- typography, palette, and motion voices;
- one `aesthetic_risk` with evidence, a quiet zone, usability guard, and
  fallback;
- concrete visual patterns this product should avoid;
- one representative-content fixture shared by all concepts.

`desired_impression` and `anti_goals` are non-empty lists of concrete text.
Their length follows the design decision; add entries only when they express
another useful constraint. The three comparable concepts remain required for
full-profile human selection.

The visual world should make tradeoffs. “Precise, calm, and capable; like a
live technical notebook whose active run leaves a clear trace” is actionable.
“Clean modern Fluent UI” is not. Name what stays quiet as well as what receives
emphasis.

Use semantic palette roles that can map to Fluent Light and Dark tokens. A comp
may explore brand character, but it must not require hard-coded colors,
inaccessible contrast, a second design language, or opaque fills that erase the
window material.

## Define one icon system

Before composing concepts, define the shared icon family, provenance, source
grid, compact and standard glyph sizes, action slot, stroke character,
outline/filled behavior, semantic color policy, and icon-only accessibility
rule. Follow [Iconography](iconography.md). Concepts may use the system with
different emphasis, but may not win by switching to a more fashionable pack or
mixing unrelated families.

Record an `icon_strategy` for each visual direction. It should explain how the
shared family supports that concept's hierarchy and state model, not rename the
family. The high-fidelity comps must show representative navigation, routine
action, selected/active, status, and disabled treatment when those states
exist.

## Use representative product content

Use a shared content fixture so differences in copy length, row count, or state
do not bias the comparison. Derive it from repository evidence, or explain why
a synthetic fixture is representative. Include a stable id, one end-to-end
scenario, at least three real strings or data values, and at least two meaningful
states.

Every full-profile comp must use that same fixture id, theme, viewport, product
moment, and content quantity. Preserve long labels, realistic status text,
errors, and mixed-height content that materially affect the composition. Do
not use lorem ipsum, control names, raw protocol labels, or empty rectangles.

## Produce three high-fidelity comps

Use [init_design_brief.py](../scripts/init_design_brief.py) to initialize the
brief, [render_design_board.py](../scripts/render_design_board.py) for the
comparison board, and [validate_design_brief.py](../scripts/validate_design_brief.py)
with `--stage concepts` before presenting it. The default approved-stage gate
is described under human selection below.

Create three concepts before writing or rearranging production GUI code. The
bundled recipes provide different information architectures; they do not
provide the art direction. For each concept, define:

- a memorable direction name;
- composition character and reading rhythm;
- semantic palette strategy;
- typography strategy;
- icon strategy using the shared icon family;
- how subject vernacular becomes structure rather than decoration;
- one signature visual or interaction move;
- one controlled aesthetic risk and its usability guard;
- one restraint rule;
- one reason the direction may fail.

Then create one local high-fidelity comp file per concept. Use an available
design workflow such as Figma export, raster composition, SVG, or a code-native
static mockup. Each result must show a resolved desktop window; wireframes do
not meet this requirement.
The comp must be at least 960 × 600 logical pixels and show:

- the complete normal-size window and its material/layer relationship;
- actual product copy and data from the shared fixture;
- resolved type scale, weight, spacing, palette, radius, icon treatment, and
  primary/secondary emphasis;
- the hero interaction and a meaningful active, completion, empty, or error
  state;
- enough content to expose density, wrapping, and hierarchy weaknesses.

A region diagram, component inventory, grayscale skeleton, or generated image
with unreadable pseudo-text does not count as a high-fidelity comp. A
design-capable image model may broaden atmosphere, composition, and material;
resolve the candidate in a second pass with readable real copy, native control
anatomy, and explicit interaction states. Do not ask it to invent product
claims or ship the concept image as UI.

When a full window makes a high-risk area unreadable, create a fresh resolved
detail or state comp at useful resolution. Do not treat a blurry crop as the
source of truth.

Full concepts already need different topologies. They must also differ pairwise
in at least three of composition character, palette strategy, typography
strategy, and signature move. Three color treatments of the same shell fail.

## Critique genericity and expose tuning axes

Before human review, record a `genericity_review` with the likely untuned
solution, concrete cliches detected in the concepts, at least one revision, and
why the revised signature remains recognizable without brand marks. Reject a
choice that could move unchanged into an unrelated product.

Record all six global `tuning_axes` from
[Design intelligence](design-intelligence.md), each with a 1 to 5 value and a
semantic note. These axes make feedback such as “less large,” “quieter,” or
“more tactile” update the whole direction instead of producing local patches.

## Score the visual system

Score every concept from 1 to 5 and attach a concrete note for each dimension:

- workflow fit;
- product signature;
- visual hierarchy;
- density and typography;
- theme and material;
- iconography;
- surface composition;
- responsive quality;
- state and interaction polish.

Judge each comp at native size. The scores help a human compare tradeoffs;
they do not select a winner, and not every score needs to reach 4 at concept
time. `surface_composition` measures the relationships among material, panes,
cards, dividers, borders, radius, and empty space. Adding containers does not
improve the score. A score of 0, a placeholder note, or a missing dimension
blocks `CONCEPTS READY`. The board shows all nine scores below each comp.

## Require a human decision

Render the shared comparison board after the comp files exist:

```bash
python3 <skill-root>/scripts/render_design_board.py \
  /path/to/design-brief.json --output /path/to/design-board.svg
python3 <skill-root>/scripts/validate_design_brief.py \
  --stage concepts /path/to/design-brief.json
```

Present the board in a neutral order with the raw comps available at full
resolution. Describe the product evidence and concept risks, but do not silently
select the first recipe or turn an agent preference into user approval. Ask the
user or named human design owner to select one concept, reject all concepts, or
request a revision.

Record the decision under `approval`:

- `status`: `pending`, `rejected`, or `approved`;
- `decision_maker_kind`: `human`;
- a non-secret `decision_maker_id` distinct from the implementation
  `author_id`;
- decision time, selected concept id, concrete selection reason, and concrete
  rejection reason for every other full-profile concept.

`pending` and `rejected` are valid review states, but they are implementation
stops. If all concepts are rejected, revise the visual world or produce new
concepts. Do not approve the least-disliked option.

After recording approval, run the default gate:

```bash
python3 <skill-root>/scripts/validate_design_brief.py \
  /path/to/design-brief.json
```

Only the default `PASS` result authorizes implementation. `CONCEPTS READY`
means the artifacts are ready for a human decision, not for C++ work.
Rerender the board after approval when the handoff artifact should visibly mark
the human-selected concept.

## Extract and carry the implementation design system

After approval and before production UI code, fill `implementation_spec` from
the selected comp. Record the source concept, container model, semantic tokens,
typography roles, component families, state grammar, motion cues, responsive
rules, locked decisions, allowed adaptations, known risks, and comparison
regions. The default validator rejects an approved v4 brief without this
handoff.

The selected comp defines the visual contract; repository and FluentQt APIs
define behavior. Implement its relationships with semantic tokens, shared
metrics, layouts, models, and FluentQt components. Avoid fixed geometry that
breaks under layout changes, and correct comp errors that violate accessibility,
localization, platform behavior, or component semantics.

Compare the first runnable vertical slice with the selected comp. Record every
material deviation in hierarchy, density, typography, palette role, signature
move, or pane lifetime. Fix each deviation or obtain a new human decision before
keeping it.

The final independent visual review remains separate. Human concept approval
chooses the intended direction; contract v4 evidence checks whether the built
application reached it across themes, sizes, states, and interactions.

## Reject common aesthetic shortcuts

- default-selecting the first generated recipe;
- using logo and accent color as the only identity;
- placing every event, row, or setting in the same rounded card;
- adding gradients, glow, pills, or oversized headings without product meaning;
- presenting three variants that share type, hierarchy, and signature move;
- mixing icon packs, emoji, or arbitrary glyphs to make one concept feel richer;
- treating the visual scorecard as arithmetic selection instead of evidence;
- polishing a sparse shell while using placeholder or developer-facing copy;
- treating a schematic design board as pixel-quality evidence;
- allowing the implementation author to record human approval.

## Art-direction acceptance gate

Before implementation of a full-profile GUI or major redesign:

- the art direction is specific, evidence-backed, and names concrete anti-goals;
- subject vernacular and taste evidence are recorded without turning references
  into templates;
- one controlled aesthetic risk has evidence, restraint, a usability guard, and
  a fallback;
- all concepts use the same representative content, theme, and viewport;
- one coherent icon family and its provenance, sizing, state, color, and
  accessibility policies are recorded;
- three structurally and aesthetically distinct high-fidelity comps exist;
- all nine visual dimensions have a concrete 1 to 5 score and comp-specific note;
- genericity critique records at least one concrete revision and all six tuning
  axes are defined;
- the comparison board embeds those comps rather than only region diagrams;
- a human has approved one concept and rejected the alternatives with reasons;
- the approved concept has a complete implementation spec rather than an
  informal “make it look like the mockup” handoff;
- the default design-brief validator reports `PASS`.

Before final acceptance, the built app still expresses the approved signature
without its logo or accent, and any material deviation has a recorded human
decision rather than an agent-only rationale.
