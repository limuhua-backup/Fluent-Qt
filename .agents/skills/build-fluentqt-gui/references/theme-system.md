# Theme System

Define the product theme with semantic tokens for the full palette, typography,
and density, including the accent color.

## Establish evidence

Use this evidence order:

1. existing project design tokens, brand guide, and shipped UI;
2. official product pages or current application UI;
3. repository assets and screenshots;
4. a neutral built-in Fluent baseline when no brand evidence exists.

Record the source and whether it is authoritative or inferred. Extract roles,
not isolated pixels: canvas, layer, alternate layer, primary/secondary text,
control fills, strokes, accent, focus, critical, caution, information, success,
control radius, overlay radius, typography, and density.

## Derive the palette from the approved identity

When an application has an approved mark or icon, use its clean foreground
shape as one input to the theme rather than treating the application tile as a
ready-made palette. Ignore transparent pixels, neutral tile backgrounds,
shadows, highlights, and edge anti-aliasing. Record the authoritative asset,
the selected chromatic anchor, any supporting hue, the inferred neutral
temperature, and the roles that remain independent.

Expand the anchor into semantic relationships instead of repeating one literal
color:

- accent default plus hover, pressed, subtle, disabled, focus, and text-on-
  accent roles;
- a low-chroma neutral family whose temperature can echo the identity without
  making canvas and text visibly colored;
- restrained accent-tinted selection or signature surfaces;
- critical, caution, information, and success roles chosen for meaning and
  contrast rather than extracted from the logo.

Derive Light and Dark together. Adjust lightness and chroma for each mode; do
not invert Light, reuse one hex value everywhere, or make Dark mode a black
canvas with neon brand color. If color tooling supports a perceptual space,
use it to build a coherent ramp, then verify the actual rendered controls and
text against the target project's accessibility policy.

When the logo is hidden, accent relationships, neutral temperature, focus, and
one restrained signature surface should still connect the theme to the identity.
Preserve Fluent geometry; do not add product-specific geometry branches.

## Choose the supported strategy

- Use the built-in Fluent theme when branding is not part of the task.
- Fluent is the only supported component geometry and interaction language.
  Use `fluent::UserTheme::apply()` to load the optional user-editable
  Fluent token override before constructing the main window.
- Use `fluent::UserTheme::applyAccentOverride()` when only the accent
  changes and the remaining semantic palette stays valid.
- For a C++ application-specific brand, start from
  `fluent::ThemeRegistry::defaultSnapshot()`, override complete Light and Dark
  semantic roles, then commit once with `applySnapshot()`.
- In PySide6, use the public `fluentqt.foundation` functions such as
  `apply_user_theme`, `set_accent_color`, `set_theme`, and `set_font_scale`.
  Do not invent a private full-palette API. If a full branded snapshot is
  required but not publicly bound, either scope the design to supported tokens
  or add and test the missing public binding in FluentQt.

Install tokens before constructing the main window. Persist the user's explicit
Light/Dark choice when the application has settings; a `system` choice may be
resolved at startup when cross-version dynamic system tracking is unavailable.

## Install window material with the theme

For an application-owned Fluent window, request Mica (default) or Acrylic and
let unused canvas, pane gaps, and chrome rest areas reveal it. An embedded GUI
inherits its host-owned window. Follow [Premium shell](premium-shell.md) for
both paths.

- Call `Window::setBackdropEffect(BackdropEffect::Mica)` (or Acrylic) before
  show. Do not switch to `Solid` to make screenshots look simpler.
- Use `setAutoFillBackground(false)` on hosts and gaps intended to reveal the
  owning material. Set a collection view's `backgroundVisible` to false only
  when it belongs to that continuous canvas; retain one deliberate background
  when the view is a bounded surface. If it sits on a painted host, follow the
  complete parent-surface contract in [Premium shell](premium-shell.md)
  instead of clearing through it or letting Qt restore a default base fill.
- Never apply `Qt::WA_TranslucentBackground` to descendant content widgets;
  that punches a hole through painted-Mica fallback instead of revealing it.
- Do not paint `bgCanvas` / `bgLayer` onto every `QWidget`; this hides the window
  material. Use `Card` only for an independent object.
  Follow [Signature surface](signature-surface.md) for composers and pane
  chrome on material.

Solid is allowed only when a host, capture harness, or accessibility surface
requires an opaque backing store. Record `window_backdrop_reason` in the visual
evidence manifest. Opaque host fills require `surface_fill_reason`.

## Map the whole palette

Define both modes together. For each mode, verify:

- accent default/secondary/tertiary/disabled and text on accent;
- canvas, layer, alternate layer, and solid backgrounds;
- primary, secondary, tertiary, and disabled text;
- default, secondary, strong, card, divider, surface, and focus strokes;
- default, secondary, tertiary, alternate, subtle, and disabled controls;
- critical, caution, information, and success foreground/background pairs;
- neutral greys and charts when the application uses them;
- control and overlay radius.

Maintain contrast through semantic roles. Do not derive Dark mode by merely
inverting Light mode, and do not use the brand accent for every status.

## Keep the hierarchy restrained

- Canvas is the quietest large surface.
- Sidebars and inspectors normally use an alternate layer.
- Cards introduce hierarchy only when spacing alone is insufficient.
- Use one accent primary action per local decision region.
- Standard actions remain neutral; subtle actions belong in chrome or compact
  tool areas.
- Preserve small semantic status colors even in an otherwise monochrome theme.

## Audit raw Qt widgets

FluentQt controls receive registry updates automatically. Raw Qt widgets do
not. For every visible raw widget:

1. decide whether a FluentQt component can replace it;
2. otherwise apply semantic `QPalette` roles rather than global hard-coded QSS;
3. refresh the palette when the theme changes, using a `FluentElement`/
   `FluentWidget` bridge or an application theme notification;
4. check viewports, documents, selections, links, placeholders, disabled text,
   and popup/overlay surfaces in both modes.

Keep QSS local to behavior or geometry that tokens cannot express. Avoid an
application-wide stylesheet that bypasses component states.

## Theme acceptance gate

- `theme.palette_source` and `theme.palette_derivation` record how authoritative
  identity or product evidence became semantic Light/Dark roles.
- Switching modes repaints the open window without restart.
- No visible control retains a Light background or dark text in Dark mode.
- Focus and disabled states remain legible.
- Brand literals are centralized in one application theme module.
- Theme token tests cover representative Light/Dark values and radii.
- An application-owned window requests Mica or Acrylic unless a Solid reason
  is recorded; an embedded surface preserves and records the host window.
- Pane gaps reveal the owning material rather than a stamped opaque palette,
  unless the host contract requires an opaque surface.
- The application icon, title mark, focus, selected state, and primary action
  feel related without turning routine chrome or semantic status into brand
  decoration.
