Write for a reader who is trying to make a decision or complete a task. A
document should make its scope, current status, and next action clear without
requiring the reader to reconstruct project history.

## Start with the document contract

State one of these near the title:

- **Current guide** — commands and steps for the active branch.
- **Living reference** — an inventory maintained with the implementation.
- **Accepted contract** — a behavior or API decision that remains in force.
- **Historical record** — dated evidence that must not be read as current state.

If a document mixes historical and current material, split it or label the
boundary explicitly.

Keep documentation prose in English, including existing guides with filenames
that have no language suffix. The project maintains bilingual entry points in
`README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md`.

Create Chinese versions of other documents only when explicitly requested.
Use the `.zh-CN.md` suffix for those translations and keep them aligned with
the English source. Do not put Chinese prose in an unsuffixed document.

The documentation check reports CJK text in English Markdown with its file
and line number. It checks headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and visible
link text. Exceptions are the root README, `.zh-CN.md` translations, fenced
and inline code, HTML comments, link destinations, generated navigation, and
the Chinese column of the [comment glossary](comment-style.md#glossary).
Keep Chinese example text in code spans or fenced code blocks.

## Prefer direct prose

- Lead with the outcome, constraint, or command the reader needs.
- Keep one idea per paragraph. Remove restatements of the heading.
- Prefer a short table for repeated fields and a checklist for ordered work.
- Use concrete component, file, command, and test names.
- Avoid promotional adjectives, invented maturity labels, and long chains of
  abstract nouns.
- Do not describe a completed implementation as a future plan.
- Keep Chinese prose and Chinese list items on one source line per logical
  paragraph. Do not hard-wrap CJK text to an English column width; let the
  Markdown renderer wrap it for the available viewport.

## Use visuals when they explain structure

Use the smallest visual that makes a relationship easier to understand:

| Relationship | Preferred format |
|---|---|
| Reader choice or execution path | Mermaid flowchart |
| State and event order | Mermaid state or sequence diagram |
| Ownership or hierarchy | Mermaid graph or text tree |
| Exact comparison | Table |
| Appearance or layout | Real Gallery or VisualCheck screenshot |

Every screenshot needs useful alt text. Diagrams must still be understandable
from nearby prose. Do not add decorative generated images to technical guides.

## Keep one source of truth

Do not copy changing totals, platform matrices, or API inventories into prose
unless the value is deliberately preserved as a dated snapshot. Link to the
generated source instead:

- component and sample facts: `docs/ai/generated/fluentqt-ai-catalog.json`;
- installed API facts: `site/api/catalog.json`;
- accessibility state: `docs/development/accessibility-inventory.md`;
- PySide6 exports: `bindings/pyside6/api-manifest.json`;
- binary support: `bindings/pyside6/wheel-matrix.json`.

## Keep agent instructions task-specific

Use `AGENTS.md` for the repository map, non-obvious constraints, and links to
owning guides. A Skill description should identify when the Skill applies;
its entry file should route tasks to the relevant references. Keep detailed
procedures with their owner rather than repeating them in every entry point.
Supporting references may link to scripts and assets; the entry file need not
list every resource directly. Keep descriptive fields proportional to the
decision. Use fixed counts only when they protect a specific comparison or
correctness requirement, and keep templates and validators aligned with that
requirement.

Distinguish application design, focused repairs, and library maintenance.
State the completion evidence and actual approval boundaries for each. Do not
turn a routine fix into a new design selection, or substitute a generic
instruction to "test thoroughly" for the project's named gates. Preserve
existing session authorization and task scope.

Keep repository guidance portable across agents and model versions. Treat
prompting advice as something to evaluate, not a reason to weaken API,
security, lifecycle, or visual acceptance contracts.

## Review checklist

- [ ] The title and status describe what the document is now.
- [ ] The first screen answers who the document is for and where to start.
- [ ] Current guidance is separate from historical evidence.
- [ ] Links point to canonical files rather than duplicate explanations.
- [ ] Commands are runnable from the stated directory.
- [ ] A diagram or table is present only when it improves comprehension.
- [ ] Generated catalogs and local links still validate.

Run the repository check before handing off a documentation change:

```bash
python3 tools/docs/generate_navigation.py --project-root .
python3 tools/docs/validate_documentation.py --project-root . --self-test
```

The validator requires every reader-facing Markdown file in
`docs/navigation.json` to declare a `Status`; this includes linked guides
outside `docs/`, such as contribution and PySide6 pages.

`docs/navigation.json` is the single source for the complete contents page,
breadcrumbs, section links, and previous/next navigation. Add a reader-facing
Markdown file there instead of hand-writing navigation blocks.
