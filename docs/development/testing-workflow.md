Use this workflow when choosing Qt/GTest/CTest validation commands, filtering
tests by CTest labels, running or skipping VisualCheck tests, adding test
targets with `add_qt_test_module`, or synchronizing new component directories
with README, CMake, and agent instructions.

For an ordinary fix, build the owning target and run its anchored CTest label.
Add regression coverage for the changed behavior, then expand to dependent
components or a broader tier when the affected contract requires it. Once the
relevant checks pass, repeat them only after another change or a new concern.
Documentation-only changes use the [documentation checks](documentation-style.md),
plus AI asset checks when their sources change; they do not require a C++ build.

## CTest Labels

Qt/GTest executables link the shared `FluentQtTestSupport` library. Its entry
point initializes Qt, logging, fonts, and resources once per process. Each run
uses an independent temporary application-data directory and removes it on
exit, so parallel instances of the same test binary do not share themes or
settings. Snapshot names use the executable name and remain stable across runs.
Persistence probes should keep this test identity unless their contract
explicitly requires another scope. The Gallery cold-load probe needs the real
application identity to enable persistence; it uses a process lock inside Qt's
test-data directory and restores the setting it changes.

- Register Qt component tests with `add_qt_test_module(test_<name> Test<Name>.cpp
  [extra sources...])`.
- The helper applies these labels to discovered tests: `qt`, `unit`,
  source-directory labels, target name, component name, and validation-tier
  labels.
- `ci_fast` is intentionally tiny and reserved for stable core checks used by
  the default GitHub Actions path.
- `ci_full` is the curated GitHub Actions full-validation subset. It is broad
  enough to cover core helpers, representative components, platform-sensitive
  areas, and app build smoke coverage, but it is not the exhaustive local test
  set. Keep this target list small enough for a cold macOS arm64 runner.
- `local_full` is the exhaustive non-manual Qt/GTest validation set for local
  host runs.
- `manual_visual` identifies tests that must be reviewed by running the binary
  directly. `local_desktop` identifies tests that need a real windowing desktop
  rather than the CI offscreen platform.
- The `native_window` desktop checks are excluded from `local_full`:
  they can change Spaces or window activation. They use a native QPA plugin,
  run serially, and close their test windows automatically. Build
  `test_window_mac` on macOS or `test_window_win` on Windows, then select
  `ctest --preset <host-preset> -L '^native_window$' --output-on-failure`
  in a real desktop session. Unfiltered CTest still selects these checks; use
  the documented tier filters for unattended runs.
- `visual_gate` is the opt-in representative Light/Dark/RTL snapshot compare
  (three checked-in PNGs). It is not part of `ci_fast`, `ci_full`, or
  `local_full`.
- Discovered tests also receive conservative semantic labels based on test-name
  tokens: `visual`, `interactive`, `animation`, `slow`, `platform_windows`,
  and `platform_macos`. VisualCheck tests receive `visual`,
  `interactive`, `manual_visual`, and `local_desktop`.
- Use anchored label filters so substring matches do not select adjacent
  components:

```bash
ctest --preset vcpkg-osx -L '^navigation$'
ctest --preset vcpkg-osx -L '^date_time$'
ctest --preset vcpkg-osx -L '^test_date_picker$'
ctest --preset vcpkg-osx -N -L '^ci_fast$'
ctest --preset vcpkg-osx -L '^ci_full$' -LE '^(manual_visual|local_desktop)$' --output-on-failure
ctest --preset vcpkg-osx -L '^local_full$' --output-on-failure
ctest --preset vcpkg-osx -N -L '^visual$'
ctest --preset vcpkg-osx -N -L '^manual_visual$'
ctest --preset vcpkg-osx -N -L '^local_desktop$'
ctest --preset vcpkg-osx -N -L '^visual_gate$'
ctest --preset vcpkg-osx -L '^animation$' --output-on-failure
ctest --preset vcpkg-osx -N -L '^platform_macos$'
```

Linux runs use the same anchored filters. The `vcpkg-linux` and
`vcpkg-linux-arm64` test presets exclude `local_desktop` by default; use the
matching `*-local-desktop` preset to list tests that need a real X11 or Wayland
desktop session:

```bash
ctest --preset vcpkg-linux -L '^ci_full$' --output-on-failure
ctest --preset vcpkg-linux-local-desktop -N
ctest --preset vcpkg-linux-arm64-local-desktop -N
```

- High-DPI smoke tests have the `high_dpi` label and run at 110%, 125%, 150%,
  175%, 200%, and 300% offscreen scale factors. Build `test_high_dpi` and run
  the anchored label on any host:

```bash
python3 tools/dev/fluent_qt_build.py --preset vcpkg-linux --target test_high_dpi
ctest --preset vcpkg-linux -L '^high_dpi$' --output-on-failure
```

See [High-DPI Workflow](high-dpi-workflow.md) for application integration and
real mixed-monitor review.

- Use established tokens in new test names when a semantic label should apply:
  `VisualCheck`, `Interactive`, `Animation`/`Animated`, `Slow`, `Windows`/`Win32`,
  or `MacOS`/`MacOs`/`Darwin`/`Cocoa`.
- Semantic labels are additive. VisualCheck tests still keep `qt`, `unit`,
  category, target, and component labels.

## Removing a Test Matrix Axis

When a public mode, platform abstraction, or product variant is removed, do
not delete its whole parameterized fixture until every assertion is classified:

1. Move design-neutral behavior, signal, ownership, and no-op assertions into
   the component's normal `Contract_*` fixture.
2. Keep representative Fluent Light/Dark state distinctions and painted
   geometry/color invariants when the deleted matrix was their only automated
   coverage.
3. Delete only assertions that require the removed axis or its branch-specific
   output. Do not retain a one-value compatibility matrix merely to preserve
   the old fixture shape.
4. Compare the deleted and remaining test names, then confirm that no affected
   component is left with only a skipped/manual `VisualCheck` unless another
   focused target owns its executable contract.

Run the affected component labels and `visual_gate` after the extraction.
VisualCheck remains a separate manual review surface; it does not replace
automated state and pixel invariants.

## Local static gate

Run the C++ format contract before committing or pushing, rather than using
pull-request CI as the first formatter. The check uses clang-format 15.0.0 and
formats incrementally by complete touched file, so a legacy file may produce a
larger mechanical diff the first time it is changed.

Check the current working tree before staging, the exact staged snapshots
before committing, or the committed pull-request diff before pushing:

```bash
python3 tools/quality/check_cpp_format.py --working-tree
python3 tools/quality/check_cpp_format.py --staged
git fetch origin main
python3 tools/quality/check_cpp_format.py --changed-from origin/main
```

Use `--working-tree --fix` on the affected branch to update the working-tree
copies, then review and stage the result. Keep a large mechanical rewrite in a
separate `style` commit. `--staged` checks the index blobs and `--changed-from`
checks the selected committed blobs, so unrelated unstaged edits cannot make
either check pass.

The formatter must report exactly `clang-format 15.0.0`. Set
`FLUENTQT_CLANG_FORMAT=/absolute/path/to/clang-format` or pass
`--clang-format PATH` when that executable is not the default on `PATH`.

Enable the repository hooks once per clone to run the same checker
automatically:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The pre-commit hook checks staged whitespace and C++ snapshots. The pre-push
hook checks whitespace and C++ files in every revision being pushed relative
to the pushed remote's `main` ref, even when it is not the currently checked
out branch. Both hooks are read-only and never format files. Fork workflows can
set `FLUENTQT_FORMAT_BASE` to a different local base ref.

Public-header and site changes must also keep the committed generated outputs
current. Run these deterministic checks locally; the CI planning job repeats
them before any pull request can merge, while Pages repeats them before deploy:

```bash
python3 tools/site/generate_localized_site.py --check
python3 tools/site/generate_api_reference.py --check
```

## Local integration preflight

Catch component-selection, wheel-file, generated-wrapper verifier, and Gallery
contract omissions before compiling Qt or pushing a pull request:

```bash
python3 tools/dev/fluent_qt_preflight.py --checks-only
```

The same source/packaging checks run in CI's planning job and the release
preflight. They require no Qt installation. This command does not verify
runtime ownership or compatibility; the generated-wrapper verifier's unit
tests are distinct from checking an actual generated binding.

For runtime checks, use the CI path classifier with the branch diff plus staged,
unstaged, and untracked changes. Renames include both paths. Preview the selected
tests, then supply existing configured builds:

```bash
python3 tools/dev/fluent_qt_preflight.py --base-ref origin/main --plan
python3 tools/dev/fluent_qt_preflight.py --base-ref origin/main \
  --build-dir build/vcpkg-osx --pyside-build-dir build/pyside6-local
```

Both local and CI selection map `app/` and `tests/gallery/` changes to
`fluent_qt_gallery_tests` and the `gallery` label. Mixed component/Gallery
changes combine their groups; shared library or build changes still select
the full host set. Gallery selection requires `FLUENT_QT_BUILD_GALLERY=ON`.

Build directory names are examples; use the directories configured for your
host. Native builds need `BUILD_TESTING` and `FLUENT_QT_BUILD_TESTS`; bindings
builds need `BUILD_TESTING`, `FLUENT_QT_BUILD_PYSIDE6_BINDINGS`, and
`FLUENT_QT_BUILD_PYSIDE6_GALLERY`. Repeat either build-directory option to test
other SDKs. Use `--config Debug` for a multi-configuration Debug build. The
runner reuses the adaptive build wrapper and CTest labels, excludes manual
desktop checks, defaults CTest to offscreen, and fails if no tests are selected.
It refreshes CMake generation with the existing cache before building, so newly
registered targets are available with Makefile generators as well as Ninja.
It stops at the first failure; it does not install SDKs or launch remote CI.

`build/local-preflight/report.json` records the changed paths, commit, host,
configured Qt SDKs, Python runtime versions, commands, results, and log paths.
Use `--report PATH` to retain separate runs. Exit `1` means a failed check;
exit `2` means required version coverage remains incomplete. A newer SDK pass
does not count as a minimum-version pass. The required native minimum lines
and Python compatibility/release lines come from the existing CI matrices.
Missing environments remain explicit work for another host or the matching CI
lane. A plan, cheap-check result, or local runtime result does not replace
installed-wheel, platform, or exact-commit release validation.

The Gallery wheel smoke script can also run from outside the checkout in a
clean environment containing the installed wheels. It checks the installed
wheel's `RECORD`, contract, and live routes without consulting source files.
Pass `--project-root /path/to/Fluent-QT` to additionally compare the package
with native Gallery sources and images. CI and publication always pass this
option; an invalid source root fails instead of skipping the comparison.

## Validation Tiers

Use the [CI workflow](ci-workflow.md) for fast/full triggers, reusable module
ownership, matrix sources, and release candidate routing. CI-full is a curated
subset; local-full runs the non-manual tests for the current host.

Local host full validation means configuring, building, and running all CTest
non-manual tests for the current host preset. VisualCheck tests stay in
`manual_visual`; use `-LE '^local_desktop$'` when running on a headless host:

```bash
cmake --preset vcpkg-osx
python3 tools/dev/fluent_qt_build.py --preset vcpkg-osx --target fluent_qt_all_tests
ctest --preset vcpkg-osx -L '^local_full$' --output-on-failure --timeout 180
```

```powershell
cmake --preset vcpkg-windows
python tools/dev/fluent_qt_build.py --preset vcpkg-windows --target fluent_qt_all_tests
ctest --preset vcpkg-windows -L '^local_full$' --output-on-failure --timeout 180
```

On native Windows ARM64 with the Qt `msvc2022_arm64` kit, substitute
`vcpkg-windows-arm64` for `vcpkg-windows`. An x64-hosted ARM64 cross-build can
compile the same targets but cannot execute this test preset.

When running a Windows GTest binary outside Qt Creator or a configured CMake
preset environment, validate the loader environment before starting any test
batch:

- Build one process `Path` containing the selected Qt `bin` directory and the
  matching vcpkg Debug/Release runtime directories. Do not keep competing
  process-level `Path` and `PATH` values.
- Run exactly one focused binary with `--gtest_list_tests` first. Continue only
  when that probe exits successfully.
- Automation launchers must suppress Windows loader and fault-reporting dialogs
  (for example with the documented Win32 process error-mode flags) so a missing
  dependency fails in the terminal rather than blocking the desktop.
- After the probe, execute one test binary per process and combine related
  cases with one `--gtest_filter`. Do not launch an unverified CTest batch from
  an inherited shell environment.

```bash
cmake --preset vcpkg-linux
python3 tools/dev/fluent_qt_build.py --preset vcpkg-linux --target fluent_qt_all_tests
ctest --preset vcpkg-linux -L '^local_full$' --output-on-failure --timeout 180
```

On Linux, both architecture-specific test presets intentionally exclude
`local_desktop`, so these commands run the headless-safe `local_full` subset.
Run the matching `*-local-desktop -N` preset separately to discover tests that
need a real desktop, after building the specific test target under review or
the aggregate `fluent_qt_all_tests` target. Automated CTest runs inject
`SKIP_VISUAL_TEST=1`; for real desktop behavior, run the target binary directly
without `SKIP_VISUAL_TEST` and set `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb` or `wayland` when your
session needs an explicit platform.

See [Linux Workflow](linux-workflow.md) for the desktop Linux portability target,
Ubuntu 22.04 reference dependencies, local desktop commands, Qt 5.15.2
official-kit validation, and optional WSL2 filesystem guidance.

## Component Contract Baseline

Tests whose names contain `Contract` receive the `contract` label. A desired
behavior that is not yet implemented is named `DISABLED_Contract_*` and also
receives `known_contract_gap`. Known gaps are excluded from `local_full`,
`ci_fast`, and `ci_full`. List `known_contract_gap` to inspect the current gaps; the dated Phase 1
results are recorded in the component contract baseline.

```bash
python3 tools/dev/fluent_qt_build.py --preset vcpkg-linux --target fluent_qt_contract_tests
ctest --preset vcpkg-linux -L '^contract$' -LE '^known_contract_gap$' --output-on-failure
ctest --preset vcpkg-linux -N -L '^known_contract_gap$'
```

If a future known gap is added, run it explicitly with the owning GTest binary
and `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`. Run one at a time because a lifetime or
layout gap may terminate the current process. Current accepted contracts and
deferred decisions are in
[Component Contract Baseline](component-contract-baseline.md).

Linux also provides a focused ASan/UBSan preset:

```bash
cmake --preset vcpkg-linux-sanitized
python3 tools/dev/fluent_qt_build.py --preset vcpkg-linux-sanitized --target fluent_qt_contract_tests
ctest --preset vcpkg-linux-sanitized --output-on-failure
```

`FLUENT_QT_ENABLE_SANITIZERS` is opt-in and does not affect release or ordinary
debug builds.

## VisualCheck

- Automated CTest runs inject `SKIP_VISUAL_TEST=1`; VisualCheck tests should
  skip in that mode.
- For manual UI review, run the test binary directly:

```bash
./build/vcpkg-osx/tests/components/<category>/<test_target> --gtest_filter="*VisualCheck*"
```

On Linux, use the corresponding `build/vcpkg-linux/...` or
`build/vcpkg-linux-arm64/...` binary path in an X11 or Wayland desktop session.
WSLg is also suitable as an optional local validation host. Run these binaries
directly so `SKIP_VISUAL_TEST` is not inherited from CTest.

- For deterministic snapshot generation, run a migrated VisualCheck binary with
  `VISUAL_SNAPSHOT=1`:

```bash
VISUAL_SNAPSHOT=1 ./build/vcpkg-osx/tests/components/textfields/test_label --gtest_filter="LabelTest.VisualCheck"
```

- Snapshot files are written to `build/<preset>/visual/` using stable names such
  as `<target>__<suite>__<test>[_variant].png`. Repeated runs overwrite the same
  file. Migrated VisualCheck tests still only verify that a non-empty PNG was
  written. They are not a screenshot farm and do not compare against baselines.
- If both `SKIP_VISUAL_TEST=1` and `VISUAL_SNAPSHOT=1` are set, skip behavior wins
  and no snapshot should be generated.
- VisualCheck tests must guard on `SKIP_VISUAL_TEST`, show the test window, and
  block with `qApp->exec()` until the window closes unless they branch to the
  shared snapshot helper for `VISUAL_SNAPSHOT=1`.
- Do not replace VisualCheck event-loop blocking with `QTest::qWait()`.
- Do not convert every VisualCheck into a baseline compare. The pixel gate below
  is a separate, tiny allowlist.

## Representative visual gate

A 1.7 quality-track gate for three checked-in PNGs under
[tests/visual-baselines/](../../tests/visual-baselines/README.md):

- Button Rest/Hover/Pressed/Focus/Disabled in Light LTR
- The same Button row in Dark LTR
- Compact TreeView in Light RTL

Compare uses exact logical-pixel equality via `tests::support::compareVisualImages`.
A mismatch fails the test and writes `<name>.diff.png` next to the capture under
`build/<preset>/visual/`.

If the approved state includes keyboard focus, assign the target a stable
object name and set `VisualSnapshotOptions::focusObjectName`. The snapshot
helper activates the shown window and restores that focus immediately before
capture, so a background CTest launch cannot silently drop the focus ring.

Default automated CTest still injects `SKIP_VISUAL_TEST=1`, so discovered
`VisualGateTest.*` rows skip. `VisualGate.CompareBaselines` is the row that
diffs against the checked-in PNGs. Both are labeled `visual_gate`; the compare
entry is also `local_desktop`. Neither is in `ci_fast`, `ci_full`, or
`local_full`.

Run the gate on the approval host (macOS arm64 / `vcpkg-osx`, Fusion, bundled
fonts, `QT_SCALE_FACTOR=1`, `QT_FONT_DPI=96`):

```bash
python3 tools/dev/fluent_qt_build.py --preset vcpkg-osx --target test_visual_gate
ctest --preset vcpkg-osx -L '^visual_gate$' --output-on-failure
```

Equivalent direct invocation:

```bash
VISUAL_SNAPSHOT=1 VISUAL_COMPARE=1 QT_SCALE_FACTOR=1 QT_FONT_DPI=96 \
  ./build/vcpkg-osx/tests/components/test_visual_gate
```

Regenerate baselines after an intentional visual change:

```bash
VISUAL_SNAPSHOT=1 VISUAL_UPDATE_BASELINE=1 QT_SCALE_FACTOR=1 QT_FONT_DPI=96 \
  ./build/vcpkg-osx/tests/components/test_visual_gate
```

### CI limitation

Hosted runners use `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`. Offscreen, Linux, and Windows
pixel output does not match these macOS desktop baselines (font engine, DPI,
platform plugin). The gate therefore:

- Skips on headless `offscreen` / `minimal` platforms
- Skips compare/update unless the process is macOS arm64 + Cocoa + Fusion with
  `QT_SCALE_FACTOR=1`, `QT_FONT_DPI=96`, and no per-screen scale override
- Is excluded from GitHub Actions by the `ci_fast` / `ci_full` label filters and
  by `-LE '^(manual_visual|local_desktop)$'`
- Must not be added as a default-red CI job

Keep the helper tests in `test_qt_test_environment` (synthetic image compare,
missing baseline) on the normal CTest path. Those do not render widgets against
checked-in PNGs.

See [Qt Component Test Conventions](qt-component-test-conventions.md) for
VisualCheck authoring rules.
See [Visual Review](visual-review.md) for manual UI review workflow.

## App Visual Geometry Verification

The [App Visual Geometry Verification](app-visual-geometry-verification.md)
guide owns the app-only scope, object-name convention, assertion helpers,
geometry-dump command, and the boundary between measurable layout checks and
subjective visual review.

## Component Directories

- `src/components/` should only contain directories with implemented components.
- Do not keep empty placeholder directories.
- Create a new component directory only when the first component in that
  category lands.
- When adding or removing a component directory, update the README overview,
  tests CMake, and `AGENTS.md`.

## Validation Defaults

- Configure with `cmake --preset <host-preset>` when CMake structure or test
  discovery changes. Follow [build setup](build-workflow.md#first-use-setup)
  on a fresh checkout.
- Build focused targets with `python3 tools/dev/fluent_qt_build.py
  --preset <host-preset> --target <test_target>`.
- Prefer focused CTest label runs after changing a test target:

```bash
ctest --preset vcpkg-osx -L '^test_<name>$' --output-on-failure
```
