<!-- docs-nav:top:end -->

Use this workflow when planning branches, commit messages, release tags,
changelog generation, and release automation.

This is a lightweight single-maintainer flow. The project does not use a
long-lived `develop` branch. Maintenance branches such as `release/1.0.x`
represent supported patch lines, not Git Flow release branches.

## Branches

- `main` is the default branch, the stable-tag source, and the latest promoted
  baseline. A push to `main` runs both the standard full validation gate and,
  for an untagged project version, the immutable desktop/Python release
  candidate build.
- `release/<major>.<minor>.x` branches are long-lived patch lines. The highest
  active version is the normal working branch for features, fixes, CI,
  packaging, documentation, and other maintenance.
- Commit routine single-maintainer changes directly to the latest long-lived
  release branch after appropriate validation. Do not create a short-lived
  `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `docs/*`, `ci/*`, or `chore/*` branch by default. Keeping
  the patch line linear makes tag-to-tag changelog review straightforward.
- Use older supported release branches only for deliberate backports to those
  patch lines. Do not mix new-line development into an older branch.
- Promote the intended `release/X.Y.x` commit to `main` before a stable release,
  normally with a rebase merge. Wait for both `Release ready` and
  `Release Candidate ready` on that final `main` SHA, then cut `vX.Y.Z` from
  the same commit. Treat tag creation as the publication boundary and obtain
  explicit maintainer approval first.
- After publication, merge the tagged `main` commit back into the matching
  release branch before new patch work. This synchronization merge is the
  deliberate exception to the otherwise linear patch line; it keeps the public
  tag in that branch's ancestry after a rebase merge changed commit IDs.
- Create a temporary branch only when explicitly needed for external review,
  contributor work, or risky isolation. Rebase-merge it to keep history linear,
  then delete it promptly.
- Do not create a permanent `develop` branch, and do not delete supported
  long-lived release branches.

## Commits

Use Angular-style Conventional Commits:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <summary>
```

The scope is optional. Keep the summary imperative, concise, and without a final
period.

Allowed commit types:

- `feat`: user-visible feature or new capability.
- `fix`: bug fix.
- `perf`: performance improvement.
- `refactor`: internal code change that does not alter behavior.
- `docs`: documentation-only change.
- `test`: tests or test infrastructure.
- `build`: CMake, packaging, dependencies, or build system change.
- `ci`: GitHub Actions and other CI automation.
- `style`: formatting-only change.
- `chore`: repository maintenance that does not fit another type.
- `revert`: revert a previous commit.

Suggested scopes include `components`, `gallery`, `foundation`, `windowing`,
`navigation`, `cmake`, `docs`, `ci`, and `release`.

Examples:

```text
feat(gallery): add platform design hero cards
fix(windowing): keep macOS traffic lights aligned
ci(release): add tagged release workflow
build(cmake): add release packaging preset
docs(release): document tag policy
```

For breaking changes, use either `!` in the header or a `BREAKING CHANGE:`
footer:

```text
feat(components)!: rename legacy namespace exports

BREAKING CHANGE: Consumers must include fluent component headers from
src/components.
```

Keep unrelated changes in separate commits so changelog generation can classify
them accurately.

## Versions

Use SemVer:

```text
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

- Increment `PATCH` for compatible bug fixes.
- Increment `MINOR` for new compatible functionality.
- Increment `MAJOR` for incompatible public API or packaging contract changes.
- While the project is `0.x`, incompatible public changes may use a `MINOR`
  bump, but the commit or release notes should still call out the break.

Until a dedicated version file exists, the root CMake project version is the
source of truth:

```cmake
project(FluentQt VERSION X.Y.Z LANGUAGES CXX C)
```

Release automation must verify that the tag version and CMake project version
match.

## Tags

Use annotated SemVer tags with a leading `v`:

```text
vX.Y.Z
vX.Y.Z-rc.N
```

Examples:

```bash
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0"
git tag -a v0.2.0-rc.1 -m "Release v0.2.0-rc.1"
```

Rules:

- Stable releases use `vX.Y.Z`.
- Release candidates use `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`.
- Tags must point at a commit whose CMake project version matches the tag.
- Do not move or replace a public release tag. Publish a patch release instead.
- Prefer a `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` commit when the release updates version
  metadata, changelog files, or packaging metadata before tagging.

## Changelog

Use Conventional Commits between release tags as the auditable maintainer
changelog. Do not publish that commit list directly as public release notes.
Public notes need an editorial pass that groups iterative commits into a few
user-visible outcomes and explains why the release matters.

Store reviewed public notes at `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` before creating the
tag. Start with a short release theme, then describe capabilities and fixes in
user language. Avoid commit scopes, implementation-only terminology, repeated
entries for the same problem, and generic maintenance summaries. Link to the
full comparison when commit-level detail is useful.

Maintainer changelog review can still group commits as follows:

| Commit type | Changelog section |
| --- | --- |
| `feat` | Features |
| `fix` | Bug Fixes |
| `perf` | Performance |
| `build`, `ci` | Build & CI |
| `docs` | Documentation |
| `refactor` | Refactoring |
| `test` | Tests |
| `chore`, `style` | Maintenance or omitted |

Breaking changes must be called out in a dedicated section even when the project
is still below `1.0.0`.

Use the generator for both reviewed public notes and maintainer changelog
review:

```bash
python scripts/release/generate_changelog.py --from v1.0.0 --to HEAD
python scripts/release/generate_changelog.py --from v1.0.0 --to HEAD --audience maintainer
python scripts/release/generate_changelog.py --tag v1.1.0 --require-curated --output release-notes.md
```

While developing the current patch line, review only its unreleased range:

```bash
python scripts/release/generate_changelog.py --from v1.3.2 --to release/1.4.x --audience maintainer --check
```

`--tag` resolves the previous release tag automatically when `--from` is not
provided. For public output, the generator automatically discovers
`docs/releases/<tag>.md`. `--require-curated` fails when that reviewed file is
missing, which is mandatory in the GitHub Release workflow. Without it, the
script may produce a commit-derived draft for local review, but that draft must
not be published unchanged.

The generator skips merge commits and `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` release-marker
commits. Use `--audience maintainer` for the detailed commit-by-commit view with
stable section ordering and short SHAs for traceability.

Use `--check` before tagging when you want to fail on commits that cannot be
classified by the Conventional Commit rules:

```bash
python scripts/release/generate_changelog.py --from v1.0.0 --to HEAD --check
```

The GitHub Release workflow publishes notes from this generator with
`--notes-file` instead of GitHub's default generated notes.

## Release Checklist

Before creating a stable tag:

1. During development, run the
   [local integration preflight](testing-workflow.md#local-integration-preflight)
   and review any missing Qt/PySide version coverage. On the matching
   `release/X.Y.x` branch, run
   `python scripts/release/preflight.py --refresh`. This quick local gate checks
   the current `main` ancestry, clean worktree, version, release notes, package
   catalogs, shared source/packaging checks, and other deterministic release
   contracts before CI starts. It does not replace runtime compatibility tests. Then
   confirm the maintainer has explicitly approved making the version public.
2. Add and review `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`, then preview it with
   `--require-curated` and review the maintainer changelog from the previous
   release tag. The automatic candidate refuses to package an untagged version
   without these curated notes.
3. Rebase-merge the approved commit into `main`; do not tag the pre-merge
   release-branch SHA.
4. Confirm `main` and the worktree are clean, point at the intended commit, and
   declare the intended CMake project version.
5. Wait for the automatic `CI full` run triggered by the `main` push. If a
   manual rerun is needed, use
   `gh workflow run CI --ref main -f matrix=full -f python_release_bundle=false`.
   The GitHub Release workflow requires the exact tagged commit to have a
   successful `Release ready` check; do not substitute a tree-equivalent run
   from the release branch or disable `require_ci` for a standard release.
   For an untagged release-ready version, this run leaves the macOS ARM64
   CPython 3.11 representative to the simultaneous Release Candidate instead
   of compiling the same wheel twice.
   If the change touches CMake, tests, Qt compatibility, platform behavior, or
   component input/windowing behavior, include the Ubuntu 22.04 Linux validation
   covered in [Linux Workflow](linux-workflow.md).
6. Wait for `Release Candidate ready` on the same `main` SHA. It must contain
   the nine desktop packages, the 18-wheel Python bundle, and a receipt binding
   both candidates to that repository and commit. Together with `Release ready`,
   this is also the macOS ARM64 Python representative gate for the release
   commit. For a post-tag recovery, run
   `Release Candidate` manually from the tag instead of weakening the identity
   checks. For Windows/macOS packages, verify the installed runtime notices and
   retain the exact corresponding Qt source required by their Qt `NOTICE.md`.
7. Create and push an annotated tag on that exact SHA.
8. Let the stable Release workflow verify and promote the immutable candidates,
   package the source and Agent Skill, then publish the GitHub Release, one
   aggregate `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and the synchronized Python release.
9. Require the linked Python run to verify TestPyPI, PyPI, attestations, and
   clean installation of both distributions.
10. Merge the tagged `main` commit back into `release/X.Y.x` before continuing
   patch development on that line.

Stable releases publish the supported PySide6 distributions to TestPyPI and
PyPI; follow the
[Python publishing runbook](../../bindings/pyside6/PUBLISHING.md). The normal
`CI full` run remains focused on validation. In parallel, the automatic
`Release Candidate` workflow builds the expensive 18-wheel bundle and desktop
packages before tagging. A stable tag verifies their commit-bound manifests
and promotes them without recompiling, then runs TestPyPI → verification →
PyPI → attestation and install verification. Release is not green until the
linked Python workflow succeeds. Manual candidate and Python dispatches are
recovery tools, not standard release steps.

Later automation may perform these steps, but the rules above remain the
contract that CI, changelog, and packaging workflows should enforce.

## Release Package Sets

- `standard` is the default stable release package set. It publishes the
  nine supported release package lanes:
  - Qt 5.15 Windows x64 installer.
  - Qt 5.15 macOS x64 DMG.
  - Qt 5.15 Ubuntu 22.04 x64 DEB.
  - Qt 6.2 Windows x64 installer.
  - Qt 6.2 Ubuntu 22.04 x64 DEB.
  - Qt 6.2 Ubuntu 22.04 arm64 DEB.
  - Qt 6.9.3 macOS x64 DMG.
  - Qt 6.9.3 macOS arm64 DMG.
  - Qt 6.9.3 Windows arm64 installer.
- `smoke` runs only the Qt 6.9.3 macOS x64 and Qt 6.2 Windows x64 package
  lanes without publishing and is intended for manual release workflow
  validation.

The package catalog lives in `.github/package-matrix.json`; `standard` and
`smoke` are selected from that shared source of truth.
